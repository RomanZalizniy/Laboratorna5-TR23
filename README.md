In this code, we use the Scanner class to read the radius of a circle from the keyboard. Next, we use the formula to calculate the area of a circle: πr^2, where π is the number pi and r is the radius of the circle. The calculated area is stored in the variable area. Finally, we print the result to the screen using the System.out.println() function.

In this program, we define three variables a = 10, b = 5, and c = 7, which we pass to the findMinimum() method. In the method, we compare these variables to find the smallest number and return it. After we call the method from the main program, we display the smallest number found on the screen.

In this program, we create an array arr with the numbers 1 through 5, and then call the printArray() method, passing it this array as an argument.

In the printArray() method, we iterate over all the elements of the array and display them on the screen, separating the values with a space. At the end, we print a newline character (\n) to make it easy to read the output on the screen.

In this program, we create an array arr with numbers and call the findMax() method, passing it this array as an argument. In the findMax() method, we initialize the max variable with the first element of the array, and then iterate through all the elements of the array, comparing each element to the max variable. If the array element is greater than max, then we change the value of max. At the end, we return the max variable containing the largest number in the array. In the main() method, we display the result on the screen.
